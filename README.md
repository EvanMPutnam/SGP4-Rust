# Project

This is just a test bed where I am using ChatGPT 5 to experiment with porting a python library to Rust.

This repo may be broken in weird places, may not have idiomatic rust, and definitely is not an ideal state...

I just want to see how close with prompting I can get to completely duplicating the python [project](https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/).
